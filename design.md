# DynamoDB Tiered Sharded Access Library – Requirements Document

## Overview

This document defines the architectural and functional requirements for a **DynamoDB Tiered Sharded Access Library**.  
The library provides **automatic partition key suffixing** (for hot partition mitigation) and **transparent query routing** across **DynamoDB Standard and Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)** tables to support **tiered storage transparency**.

---

## Objectives

1. Ensure even data distribution across partitions via automated key suffix sharding.  
2. Abstract DynamoDB table class (Standard vs Standard-IA) boundaries from application logic.  
3. Provide unified query APIs for read/write operations across both tiers.  
4. Enable dynamic data tier migration and optional data rehydration on recent access.  
5. Maintain full compatibility with AWS SDK for DynamoDB (no changes to client application data model).
6. Enable adding suffix to a partitiona key when its required more performance
7. Scheduled Object Life Cycle from Hot to IA Storage tier by different strategy

## Functional Requirements

### Key Sharding

- The library must generate and append suffixes to partition keys to spread items across multiple partitions.
- Supported suffixing strategies:
  - **RandomSuffixPolicy**: Uniform random suffix within range (e.g., 0–99).
  - **HashBasedPolicy**: Deterministic suffix generation using hash modulo logic.
  - **CustomPolicy**: Developers may inject custom suffixing logic (e.g., per-tenant or per-day).
- Reads/query operations must transparently handle expanding all suffix variants for a given base key.

### Tiered Access Transparency

- The library must read/write across **two DynamoDB tables**:
  - **Hot table** → DynamoDB Standard
  - **Cold table** → DynamoDB Standard-IA
- Table selection logic must be handled by a **TierSelectionStrategy**.
  - Policies may include:
    - **AgeBasedTierStrategy**: Select based on item creation or last-access timestamp.
    - **CustomTierStrategy**: User-defined logic, e.g., workload or cost metrics.

- Querying should:
  - Search both hot and cold tiers in parallel asynchronously.
  - Aggregate and de-duplicate results before returning.
  - Fallback to IA table only when no results exist in Standard (for latency optimization).

## Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Performance** | The routing overhead must add < 10% latency over native SDK calls under moderate load. |
| **Scalability** | Must support sharding factor configuration (e.g., 10, 100, or adaptive). |
| **Transparency** | Expose a single API façade identical to `DynamoDbClient` to avoid application changes. |
| **Resilience** | Handle partial failure in one table tier and return partial results with warnings. |
| **Maintainability** | Policy classes should be pluggable and configurable at runtime. |
| **Security** | Use IAM-based per-table credentials; ensure no cross-tier data leakage. |
